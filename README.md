# 2D-Game
A map of the size you specify is created. Various obstacles in various numbers are placed on this map. When you press the start button, the map is covered with fog, so the character does not know the location of any chests. The character then wanders the map looking for chests, starting from a random location. As he wanders, the fog lifts from the map and the paths he walks are colored red. When all the chests are found, the shortest route is found using the A* algorithm and colored green.
